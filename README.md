# Network-on-Chip
This project created for modeling of Network on Chip with simple routers and different topologies. After modeling statistics can be counted by special script.

For working Modelsim must be installed.

Configuring NoC in `src/configs.vh`

To run NoC testbench: `tests/test_NoC_modelsim.bat`

In .bat file used `rout_table_gen.py` script. It generates a routing table for topologies. To get additional info run `rout_table_gen.py -h`.
